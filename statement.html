      For this project, I wanted to create something that would
      give everyone a boost of serotonin. It’s finals, everyone is stressed,
      and what better way to destress than to see a bunch of cute ducks in a cute forest.
       One of my favorite games to play is Animal Crossing and 
       it’s the game I play to relax and unwind so I got my main inspiration from there.

  I used three.js, GLTFLoader.js, and PointerLockControls.js.
